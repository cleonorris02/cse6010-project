# CSE 6010 Group 2 Project

This project explores a novel approach to genomic data security by combining DNA sequence representation with modern cryptographic methods. We build upon the methodology introduced in Dokyun Na’s paper “DNA steganography: hiding undetectable secret messages within the single nucleotide polymorphisms of a genome and detecting mutation-induced errors”, published in Microbial Cell Factories, by adapting the framework to incorporate the XChaCha20 encryption algorithm in place of the simple substitution cipher originally used. XChaCha20 offers significant advantages in speed, scalability, and resilience against timing attacks, making it a compelling candidate for protecting sensitive biological information. Using a publicly available DNA sequence dataset from Kaggle, our system encodes encrypted data into genomic sequences and evaluates whether the efficiency and robustness of XChaCha20 can be effectively applied in this context. The goal of this project is to assess the feasibility of stronger encryption techniques within DNA-based data hiding, thereby extending the state of the art in secure storage and transmission of biological information. 

## DNA Hotspot Encryption (Preprocessed Strings)

This module encrypts preprocessed hotspot DNA strings using libsodium's XChaCha20 stream cipher while parallelising the workload across seven OpenMP threads. Instead of parsing the original hotspot blocks, it consumes a TSV export produced by `python/pre_two.py`, which already condenses hotspot regions into standalone DNA strings.

### Building

```bash
cd encryption_preprocessed
make
```

> **Note:** libsodium headers and libraries must be installed on your system. The provided Makefile links against OpenMP (`-fopenmp`) and libsodium (`-lsodium`).

### Usage

```bash
./dna_hotspot_encryptor \
  --input ../processed_data/snp_hotspots_strings.tsv \
  --key ../keys/xchacha20.key \
  --output encrypted_hotspots.tsv
```

* `--input` points to the TSV created by the preprocessing stage. The file must contain a header row. At minimum, one column with DNA strings is required (`hotspot_string`, `hotspot_sequence`, `sequence`, or `dna_string`). Optional columns such as `record_id`, `hotspot_positions`, or `reference` are used as metadata.
* `--key` specifies a file with a 256-bit key encoded as hexadecimal characters (64 hex characters).
* `--output` identifies the TSV that will receive the encrypted payload.
* `--threads` (optional) overrides the default of seven worker threads.

Each output row contains:

| Column | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `record_id` | Identifier of the hotspot string. Auto-generated if not provided in the TSV. |
| `nonce_dna` | Encryption nonce encoded as a DNA string (A/C/G/T). |
| `ciphertext_dna` | Ciphertext encoded as a DNA string, ready for downstream embedding. |

### Data expectations

The TSV generated by `python/pre_two.py` resembles the following (tabs shown as `→`):

```
record_id→hotspot_positions→reference→hotspot_string
chr12_0001→265043,265075,265101→GGCATTAAGTCCCATAGGGGTATGCTTAACTTTTGAT→ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT
chr12_0002→506152,506172→CTCAGCGTCCCGCCCTTACACTCCCCCGCCCCTCCC→TGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCA
```

The encryptor incorporates hotspot positions and reference sequences into the plaintext when available, ensuring the encrypted payload contains the contextual metadata required for reconstruction.

### Parallel execution

The tool enforces seven OpenMP threads by default to satisfy the throughput requirements of the downstream pipeline. Adjust `--threads` only when necessary for benchmarking or alternative deployments.
